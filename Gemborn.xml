  <description>
    <p class="flavor">Crystalline beings with natural armor and resistance to toxins, Gemborn are a race of sentient gem-like humanoids.</p>
    <h4>CRYSTALLINE FORMS</h4>
    <p>Gemborn appear as humanoid figures composed of crystalline material, reflecting the gemstone type they embody. Their bodies are solid yet still possess articulation and flexibility, allowing them to move naturally. Gemborn have faceted features and their skin can range from opaque to translucent depending on the individual. They come in various colors and patterns that match their corresponding gemstone.</p>
    <p class="indent">The eyes of a Gemborn often glow with an inner light, and many emit a subtle shimmer in certain lighting conditions. Gemborn do not have hair in the traditional sense, but many develop crystal formations that mimic hair or other decorative features.</p>
    <h4>ANCIENT ORIGINS</h4>
    <p>The origins of the Gemborn are often tied to ancient magical events or elemental forces. Some believe they were created by powerful mages or deities, while others theorize they emerged naturally from areas where magic and minerals converged over countless centuries. Regardless of their beginnings, Gemborn are now an established, if uncommon, presence in the world.</p>
    <p class="indent">Gemborn communities are typically small and often situated near mineral-rich locations or areas of natural magical energy. They can live for centuries, with some of the oldest Gemborn having memories that span a millennium.</p>
    <h4>LIVING CRYSTALS</h4>
    <p>Despite their mineral composition, Gemborn are fully sentient beings with emotions, desires, and perspectives like other races. They do not require food or water in the traditional sense, instead drawing sustenance from minerals, sunlight, or ambient magical energy. They do, however, enjoy the taste of certain minerals and crystals.</p>
    <p class="indent">Gemborn are often sought after for their natural knowledge of minerals and gems, as well as their innate connection to certain magical energies. Many find work as jewelers, miners, enchanters, or advisors on matters related to precious stones.</p>
    <h4>GEMBORN NAMES</h4>
    <p>Gemborn names often reflect qualities of light, stone, or crystal formations. Some take names based on mineral terminology or descriptive qualities of gems. Family names, if used, often describe a quality of their specific gem type or the location where they first formed.</p>

            <p>Crystallian is not a language of words, but of pure tonal resonance. It is a complex system of precisely calibrated frequencies, akin to the harmonious vibrations of countless tuning forks. Gemborn communicate by manipulating the crystalline structures within their bodies, producing a symphony of clear, ringing tones. Each distinct frequency, and the intricate patterns they form, carries meaning, conveying emotions, concepts, and even magical intent without the need for traditional words.</p>
