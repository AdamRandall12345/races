      <p>As an action, you may choose one creature within 30 feet of you and create a magical bond between the two of you. This bond lasts for one minute so long as that creature remains within 30 feet of you and you maintain concentration (as if you were concentrating on a spell). While the bond is active, at the start of your turn you take 1d6 Necrotic damage and the other creature heals twice the amount of damage you take. This Necrotic damage cannot be reduced by any means. You may use this feature a number of times equal to your Proficiency Bonus. You regain expended uses at the end of a Long Rest.</p>

            <p>Crystallian is not a language of words, but of pure tonal resonance. It is a complex system of precisely calibrated frequencies, akin to the harmonious vibrations of countless tuning forks. Gemborn communicate by manipulating the crystalline structures within their bodies, producing a symphony of clear, ringing tones. Each distinct frequency, and the intricate patterns they form, carries meaning, conveying emotions, concepts, and even magical intent without the need for traditional words.</p>
