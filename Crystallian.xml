            <p>Crystallian is not a language of words, but of pure tonal resonance. It is a complex system of precisely calibrated frequencies, akin to the harmonious vibrations of countless tuning forks. Gemborn communicate by manipulating the crystalline structures within their bodies, producing a symphony of clear, ringing tones. Each distinct frequency, and the intricate patterns they form, carries meaning, conveying emotions, concepts, and even magical intent without the need for traditional words.</p>
